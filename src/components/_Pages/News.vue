          Deoel Villamor of Team Eswar in the Open Division II-A bracket provided spectacular shooting display en route to a win by his team against Alberta Health Supplies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alberta Health Supplies tried to keep the game close but was not able to sustain the onslaught of Villamor's hot shooting scoring a total of 42 points with 6 threes made to
          put the game away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Villamor was virtually unstoppable as all defenders tasked in covering his spots have been rendered helpless to his sweet stroke on the court.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other games also featured high scoring output from individual players, but for the recently concluded weekend games, Deoel Villamor deserves top honors to be named 
          player of the week.
