          of the voting and stated:
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            "Our new set of officers will continue to improve and promote to the Filipino community 
            the sports of basketball in Edmonton. I have seen the commitment and dedication of each
            officer and their desire for the betterment of the league as a whole."
